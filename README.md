# dtt
shitty script that runs a basic autoinstall of arch linux  
obviously not intended for people who need fde or similar (yet?)

`chmod +x dothething.sh && ./dothething.sh` and go get some coffee or tea or something  

### planned changes  
* full-disk encryption support
* sort of automatic wlan configuration
* better partitioning scheme
* other things
